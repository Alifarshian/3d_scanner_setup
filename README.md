# 3d_scanner_setup
This repository contains the code developed for my Bachelor project. It includes three main files: an Arduino sketch (.ino) that should be uploaded to the Arduino board, a Python script (.py) for controlling the stepper motors using keyboard input, and a Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) for initializing and running the Azure Kinect camera. Together, these components form the hardware and software setup of the project, where the Arduino handles low-level control, the Python script provides user interaction with the stepper motors, and the notebook enables camera operation through the Azure Kinect SDK.
